# The-visualization-of-gradient-descent-algorithm
Final Project of the course, data visualization

In this project, we want to visualize the application of gradient descend algorithm in regression. With the help of the project, we expect the players can have a better understand of the algorithm, including its advantages and limitations by setting the related parameters such as learning rate, initial parameters, the number of iterations. We believe that a better understand of its limitations will benefit a lot when when we apply gradient descend algorithm to solve problems.
